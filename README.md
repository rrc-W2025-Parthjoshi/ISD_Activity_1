## Additional Information
This activity is meant to help me get comfortable with Python classes and OOP basics. By doing it, I’ll practice:

- Reading and using class diagrams to build working Python classes.
- Using private and public attributes properly and making accessors with @property.
- Adding checks and handling errors in constructors so the program doesn’t break with bad input.
- Writing unit tests based on a test plan to make sure my code actually works.
- Using a client program to create and work with objects, which shows how the class behaves in real use.
